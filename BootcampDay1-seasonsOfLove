// 2016 is a leap year. 366 days in leap year. 365 days in non-leap year.
// Myfirst method was to write the var i = year-2016 in order to have a multiple or non multiple of 4 later. But I could 
// skipped that if I directly wrote down (if year%4) {...} else if {...}. That would have been more direct
// Then again, using ternary statements is much better. return (condition) ? (code if true) : (code if false). 
// Ternary statements. TO REMEMBER.
