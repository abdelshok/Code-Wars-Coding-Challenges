Directions
Create the function askPolitely that accepts a sentence 
as an argument. If the last character of the sentence is 
a question mark, then make sure the question ends with 
the word "please".

If the sentence is not a question, then return the 
inputted string without modification. If the sentence 
is a question, but already has a please, then also
return the input without modification.

/////

function askPolitely(question) {
	if (question[question.length-1] === "?" && question.indexOf("please") === -1) {
		return question.slice(0, question.length-1) + " please?";
	}
	else if (question.indexOf("please") !== -1 && question[question.length-1] === "?") {
		return question;
	}
	else { return question;}
}
askPolitely("May I borrow your pencil?");


// All the tests worked out

// Another way to do it would have been to use nested if statements. First declare an if statement with teh conditional of
a question mark in the end (question[question.length-1] === "?"). When that is true, it can move inside the block and run
other conditionals. One hwere there is a "please" (using indexOf method to see if there is one) and one where there isn't.
And running the according strings respectively.
