Create the function doYouPlayTheTheremin. If your name starts with the letter "S" or "s", you are playing the Theremin!
Examples
- INPUT: doYouPlayTheTheremin("Griffin")
- OUTPUT: "Griffin does not play the Theremin!";

- INPUT: doYouPlayTheTheremin("Scott");
- OUTPUT: "Scott plays the Theremin!";

///

function doYouPlayTheTheremin(name) {
	if (name == "Griffin") { 
		return name + " does not play the Theremin!";
	}
	else if (name == "Scott" || name[0] === "s") {
		return name + " plays the Theremin!";
	}
}
doYouPlayTheTheremin("scott")

// Too specific. Not dynamic enough. We need to make it less specific. If its an S, then we return plays the theremin.
// If its not, then we return "does not play"

function doYouPlayTheTheremin(name) {
	if (name[0] === "S" || name.charAt(0) === "s") { 
		return name + " plays the Theremin!";
	}
	else{return name + " does not play the Theremin!";
	}
}
doYouPlayTheTheremin("scott")

// Second one is better because less specific. The examples were just examples. Most important part was the upper and
lower case "S"
