DIRECTIONS:

Create a function `greeting(name)` that accepts a name argument and returns a personalized greeting if a name is present.

The Function takes a name as its only argument and returns one of the following strings:
- INPUT: greeting("Charlotte");
- OUTPUT: "Hello, Charlotte!";

- INPUT: greeting();
- OUTPUT: "Hello!";

///

Method 1:

function greeting(name) {
	if (name === undefined) {
		return "Hello!"
	}
	else { return "Hello, " + name + "!"}
}

greeting("Joe")

Method 2:

function greeting(name) {
if (name) {return "Hello, " + name + "!"}
else {return "Hello!"}
}
greeting("Chad")

// CONCLUSION: Method2 IS MUCH BETTER. Less specific and more reusable as it is not just limited to undefined data types, 
// but any other falsy. Here we used falsy and truthy. If the value is a truthy, then the code is run. That is enough.
